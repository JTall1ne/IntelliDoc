# IntelliDoc

IntelliDoc is an open-source tool that uses artificial intelligence to automatically generate and update code documentation based on changes in your repository. It analyses commit diffs, understands the structure of your code and produces human-friendly documentation that stays in sync with your source.

## Features

- **Automated documentation generation** – Runs on each commit to produce or update README and API docs for supported languages.
- **Multi-language support** – Works with popular programming languages like Python, JavaScript and Java.
- **CI/CD integration** – Ready to run via GitHub Actions or other pipelines to enforce up-to-date documentation on every push.
- **Web-based review interface** – Provides a simple UI to preview and edit generated documentation before publishing.
- **Open-core architecture** – The core is open source and free; advanced features will be available via an optional hosted version.
